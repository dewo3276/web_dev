<h1>Destin Woods</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Destin Woods. I love to hike, ski, camp, and climb. After 5 years at CU, I have joined many clubs including: men's chorus, CUSEDS, One Note Stand A Cappella, and the CU sailing team (sailing in a landlocked state is kinda weird I know). I currently work at University Theater and Dance as the Master Carpenter and have been working there for 4 years. </p>
<p>My interest in web technologies stemed from a great coding expirience in Web. I love coding in html, css, and javascript because this type of code is a very creative process that I can directly see what my actions result in. Normally I don't enjoy code, but when I get the gratification of seeing the code updated live and the direct result imediately gives me great joy. Coding for the web also just makes much more sense than any other syntax I have used because it uses real words rather than obscure abbreviations that I can never remember.</p>
<p>What I really seek to learn in this class is to advance these skills further and create more dynamic sites. So far my knowledge has helped me in past jobs and this is just another tool I want to have in my back pocket for whatever comes my way. I am excited to learn about some more advanced coding within the realm of web to create animated and a more in-depth human expirience within the web.</p>
